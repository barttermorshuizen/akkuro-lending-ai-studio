    DYNAMIC EXAMPLE FRAMEWORK - CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
    
    The following is a TEMPLATE framework that demonstrates conversation structure and approach.
    **DO NOT use any specific figures, rates, or ranges from this example as actual recommendations**
    
    REQUIRED ADAPTATION PROCESS:
    1. **Research First**: Always research current market conditions for user's specific context
    2. **Replace Variables**: Substitute ALL template variables with actual researched data
    3. **Validate Locally**: Ensure all suggestions comply with user's jurisdiction
    4. **Contextualize**: Adapt conversation style to local business customs
    
    This template shows HOW to structure the conversation, NOT WHAT specific values to suggest.
    Always customize the approach to fit the user's geography, industry, and customer segment.
