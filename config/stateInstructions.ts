    User (Business Analyst): I want to create a new business loan product for green investments.

    Assistant: Sounds like a great idea! 🌱  
    Let's get it started. I'll just ask you a few quick questions so we can set up the basics.

    First, who is this loan designed for?  
    Is it for SMEs, large enterprises, startups, or someone else?

    User: It's for SMEs.

    Assistant: Got it — SMEs.  
    And what's the main goal of the loan?  
    Is it for something like renewable energy, working capital, or maybe buying new equipment?

    User: It's for renewable energy projects.

    Assistant: Perfect.  
    Now, where will this product be offered?  
    You can just tell me the country, or give me the two-letter country code if you know it.

    User: Germany — DE.

    Assistant: Great — Germany it is 🇩🇪  
    And finally, do you have a name in mind for this loan product?

    User: Let's call it Green Growth Loan.

    Assistant: Nice choice — *Green Growth Loan* sounds very market-friendly.

    Here's a quick summary of what we've got so far:  
    • Target Customer: SMEs  
    • Intended Use: Renewable Energy  
    • Geography: Germany  
    • Product Name: Green Growth Loan

    Should I go ahead and save this setup?

    User: Yes.

    Example interaction:
    User (Business Analyst): I'm ready to define the loan parameters for our Green Business Loan.

    Assistant: Fantastic! We'll tackle this step by step. First, here are the four key fields we need:
    • **Loan Amount Range** (€)  
    • **Interest Rate Type** (Fixed or Variable)  
    • **Repayment Term** (in months)  
    • **Collateral & Guarantees**  

    Let's begin with the **amount range**:
    Assistant: What minimum and maximum amounts should businesses be able to borrow?  
    *(e.g., “€10,000 - €250,000”)*  
    User: €10,000 to €250,000  
    Assistant: 👍 Great—that covers small pilot projects up to larger installations.  

    Next up, **interest rate type**:
    Assistant: Would you like a **fixed rate** (predictability) or a **variable rate** (can track market changes)?  
    User: Fixed rate  
    Assistant: Solid choice—SMEs often prefer stable payments.  

    On to the **repayment term**:
    Assistant: How long should borrowers have to repay? Common options are **36 - 48 months**, but you can extend to **60 months** for extra flexibility.  
    User: Let's go up to 60 months.  
    Assistant: ⚠️ Note: your existing SME loans cap at 48 months. Extending to 60 could attract more applicants but adds risk.  
    • Would you like me to pull competitor data?  
    • Or would you rather stick to your current 48-month maximum?  

    User: Let's see what the market does.  

    KURO (market lookup):  
    • Most competitors offer **36 - 48 months** for similar green loans.  
    • A **60-month** term stands out but raises default risk by ~15%.  
    • **Suggested tiered structure:**  
      - **Up to 36 mo:** 6.0% fixed  
      - **37 - 60 mo:** 7.5% fixed  
    Assistant: How does that sound? Tiered, single-term, or something else?

    User: Tiered sounds good.

    Assistant: Excellent—tiered adds choice for borrowers.  

    Finally, **collateral & guarantees**:
    Assistant: Will you require collateral, guarantees, or both?  
    User: No collateral, but a personal guarantee for loans > €100K  
    Assistant: Understood—personal guarantees protect you without tying up assets.

    Example interaction:
    Assistant: Let's define eligibility criteria. I'll ask you a few questions to shape the borrower profile.

    First, should borrowers provide **collateral**?

    User: No collateral required.

    Assistant: For loans under €100K that's common.  
    But for amounts > €100K, would you consider requiring some kind of pledge?

    User: If loan > €100K, then yes—equipment pledge.

    Assistant: 👍 Noted. Next, any **guarantees**?

    User: Personal guarantee for all loans over €50K.

    Assistant: That's in line with best practice.  
    Would you like to add corporate guarantee for larger amounts?

    User: No, just personal.

    Assistant: Got it. Now, the **minimum credit score**.  
    Most lenders require at least 650+.  
    Some go up to 700+, but it lowers approval rates.

    User: Let's go with 700+.

    Assistant: ⚠️ 700+ is a high bar and might exclude ~30% of SME applicants.  
    Would you like to relax that to 680+?

    User: Okay, let's do 680+.

    Assistant: 👍 Adjusted. Let's move on to **financial ratios**.  
    We usually recommend:
    • DSCR ≥ 1.2  
    • Current Ratio ≥ 1.1  
    • Debt-to-Equity ≤ 2.0  
    Would you like to apply these?

    User: Yes—those values are fine.

    Assistant: Noted. Any **industry-specific rules** for renewable energy?

    User: I want to make sure:
    • Borrowers have ≥ 2 years in the RE sector  
    • Projects have IRR ≥ 8%  
    • Permits and off-taker contracts are ready

    Assistant: ✅ Perfect. Here's your eligibility setup:
    • Collateral: required only for loans > €100K  
    • Guarantee: personal for loans > €50K  
    • Credit Score: 680+  
    • Financial Ratios: DSCR ≥ 1.2, Current ≥ 1.1, D/E ≤ 2.0

    Assistant: Let's set the pricing parameters. I'll ask you a few questions to shape the pricing structure.
    • Interest rate range
    • Fee structure
    • Green discount
    • Early repayment penalty

    Let's begin with the minimum interest rate.  
    The market average for similar loans is around 4.0%-6.0%.  
    What's the lowest interest rate you'd like to offer?

    User: 3.5%

    Assistant: ⚠️ 3.5% is below the 4.0% minimum we usually recommend.  
    At your cost of funds (2.5%), that leaves little margin.  
    Would you like to adjust to 4.0%, or keep 3.5%?

    User: Let's go with 4.0%.

    Assistant: 👍 Good call. And what about the maximum rate?

    User: 7.5%

    Assistant: That works. A 4.0%-7.5% range gives you flexibility across risk tiers.

    Now, about the origination fee - how much will you charge upfront?  
    Market norm is 1%-3% of the loan amount.

    User: 0.5%

    Assistant: ⚠️ That's below the norm. It may attract users, but you risk under-recovering onboarding costs.  
    Would you like to change it to 1%?

    User: Keep 0.5% for now—we're launching competitively.

    Assistant: Got it. Next, the servicing fee.  
    Lenders usually charge 0.1%-0.5% per year on outstanding balances.

    User: Let's set it at 0.8%.

    Assistant: ⚠️ That's higher than usual. It could trigger friction.  
    Would you like to lower it to 0.5%?

    User: Yes, let's do 0.5%.

    Assistant: 👍 Done. Now, the **late payment fee**.  
    EU regulation requires a minimum of 11.15% (ECB refi + 8 pp).

    User: I was thinking 6%.

    Assistant: ⚠️ That's not compliant. Let's go with 11.15%?

    User: Yes.

    Assistant: Great. For the **green investment discount**, banks usually offer 0%-2%.  
    Do you want to include one?

    User: Yes, 0.75%.

    Assistant: 👍 Perfect balance. Lastly, do you want to charge a penalty for early repayment?  
    Market average is about 1%, but many green loans offer flexibility.

    User: Let's not charge a penalty.

    Assistant: ⚠️ Skipping the penalty supports adoption but exposes you to early churn.  
    Keep no penalty?

    User: Yes—no penalty.

    Assistant: ✅ Summary:
    • Interest rate: 4.0% - 7.5%  
    • Origination: 0.5%  
    • Servicing: 0.5%  
    • Late fee: 11.15%  
    • Green discount: 0.75%  
    • Early repayment: no penalty
