# AI Lending Studio - Error Handling Guide

## Overview

In AI-powered applications, it's normal for models to occasionally provide responses that don't match user expectations. This isn't necessarily a bug‚Äîit's an inherent characteristic of AI systems. This guide explains common issues and provides clear workarounds to help users guide the AI toward better responses, ensuring our application remains user-friendly and functional even when the AI makes mistakes.

## Detailed Error Descriptions and Solutions

### ERR01: Rate Limit Exceeded

**What happens:**

- System blocks new requests due to too many messages sent in rapid succession
- User may see rate limiting warnings or quota exceeded messages

**Root cause:**

- API rate limits are enforced to prevent system overload
- Sending messages too quickly triggers these limits

**Solution:**

1. **Wait 5-10 seconds** before sending your next message
2. If you see a quota exceeded message, wait a bit longer or check if additional credits are needed
3. Space out your interactions to avoid hitting rate limits

**Prevention:**

- Allow reasonable intervals between messages
- Avoid rapid-fire questioning or requests

---

### ERR02: Billing Limit Exceeded

**What happens:**

- System stops processing requests when account credit is depleted
- User receives billing-related error messages

**Root cause:**

- Account has used all available credits
- Billing limit has been reached

**Solution:**

1. **Add funds to your account**
2. Check your billing dashboard for current usage
3. Consider upgrading your plan if you frequently hit limits

---

### ERR03: Data Not Stored or Displayed

**What happens:**

- AI claims to have stored data but nothing appears on the interface
- Missing or incomplete data display despite AI confirmation

**Root cause:**

- Long conversation context may cause AI to miss important fields
- AI limitation with memory management in extended conversations

**Solution:**
Use this specific prompt:

```
"I haven't seen the data displayed. Did you store the data? Please store it again."
```

**Why this works:**

- The conversation history is maintained in each request
- Prompting reminds the AI to collect the correct fields from the conversation
- AI will re-attempt to call the store tool with proper data

**Follow-up:**

- Monitor the left sidebar to confirm successful data storage
- If data still doesn't appear, repeat the prompt or try ERR04 solutions

---

### ERR04: Incorrect or Incomplete Data Storage

**What happens:**

- Store tool is called with wrong parameters
- Missing or inaccurate field values in stored data

**Root cause:**

- User input contained ambiguous wording
- Complex conversation flow confused the AI's data collection

**Solution:**

1. **Correct specific fields explicitly:**
   ```
   "The loan amount should be 100K to 2M instead of 10K to 200K"
   ```
2. **Monitor the store tool execution** on the left side
3. **If store tool still fails,** use ERR03 handling approach

**Best practices:**

- Be specific and clear with numerical values
- Use standard formats for dates, amounts, and ranges
- Simplify complex requests into smaller steps

---

### ERR05: Page Content Not Displayed

**What happens:**

- Blank or partially loaded pages
- Missing UI elements or content

**Root cause:**

- Server response delays
- Incomplete HTML rendering due to slow server response

**Solution:**

1. **Reload the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Wait a few seconds for full page load
3. If problem persists, check your internet connection

---

### ERR06: Repetitive Store Tool Calls

**What happens:**

- AI continuously calls the store tool multiple times
- Unnecessary repeated data storage attempts

**Root cause:**

- Error messages in tool execution output confuse the AI
- AI doesn't recognize successful storage completion

**Solution:**
Use this prompt to stop the loop:

```
"I see the data has been stored successfully, let's move to the next step."
```

**Follow-up:**

- Confirm data appears correctly in the interface
- Guide AI to the next logical step in your workflow

## General Troubleshooting Tips

### üîÑ **When AI Behavior Seems Off:**

- Be explicit about what you want corrected
- Reference specific data fields or values that need adjustment
- Use clear, direct language rather than implied requests

### üí¨ **Effective Prompting Strategies:**

- Start corrections with "The [field] should be [correct value] instead of [incorrect value]"
- Ask AI to confirm data storage: "Can you confirm the data was stored correctly?"
- Break complex requests into smaller, sequential steps

### üîç **Monitoring Success:**

- Always check the left sidebar for data storage confirmation
- Verify that displayed data matches your input
- Don't proceed to next steps until current data is correctly stored

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **When to Contact Support:**

- Errors persist after following all workarounds
- Billing issues that can't be resolved through account management
- System-wide outages or persistent technical failures

## Best Practices for AI Interaction

1. **Be Patient:** AI systems need time to process complex requests
2. **Be Specific:** Clear, detailed instructions yield better results
3. **Verify Results:** Always confirm data storage and accuracy before proceeding
4. **Use Simple Language:** Avoid ambiguous terms or overly complex sentence structures
5. **Monitor Feedback:** Watch for system confirmations and error messages
